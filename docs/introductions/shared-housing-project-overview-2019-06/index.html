    <h2>About LA Family Housing</h2>
    
    <p>LA Family Housing (LAFH) is a non-profit organization that helps people transition out of homelessness and poverty through a continuum of housing enriched with supportive services. Our vision is to be a leader in providing solutions to end homelessness.</p>    
    
    <p>We operate 26 properties of temporary, permanently affordable, and permanent supportive housing across Los Angeles, with headquarters and most services based in the San Fernando Valley.</p>

    <h2>Shared Housing Project Overview</h2>    
    
    <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
    
    <p>LA Family Housing (LAFH) engaged the help of the Hack for LA organization to identify and design a more efficient & effective solution for shared housing placement, matching multiple individuals who experience homelessness as potential co-tenants, and placing the matched individuals in suitable shared housing units.</p>
    
    <h3>Client Proposed Solution:</h3>
    
    <p>LA Family Housing proposed a digital “match.com”-like solution for matching individuals experiencing homelessness, that matches tenants-to-tenants, and tenants-to-units. As part of the project, we’re exploring this as well as other solutions to the problem.</p>

    <h2>LAFH Stakeholders: Internal Teams</h2>
    
    <p>Internal Stakeholders (A.K.A. LA Family Housing Teams) we’ll be engaging with & talking to:
        
        <ul>
            
            <li><b>Outreach & Engagement Team:</b> Street outreach teams identify and engage homeless neighbors and individuals at risk of becoming homeless. Each individual is referred to available housing based on assessment and greatest personal needs.</li>
            
            <li><b>Housing Location Team:</b> identifies eligible housing units, inspects the units, obtains the necessary paperwork from the landlord, and hosts the “Open House” events.</li>
            
            <li><b>Housing Navigation Team:</b> consists of social workers who work with individuals experiencing homelessness to find housing, drive interest in the unit, maintain the case files, and work to facilitate optimum outcomes for individuals moving into permanent housing.</li>
            
            <li><b>Housing Stabilization Team:</b> consists of social workers who provide guidance, direction and support to individuals who have been placed in permanent housing units, and manage relationships with the landlords.</li>
            
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    
    <h2>LAFH Stakeholders: External</h2>
    
    <p>External Stakeholders:
        
        <ul>
            
            <li>Individuals experiencing homelessness</li>
            
            <li>Landlords</li>
            
            <li>Homeowners</li>
            
            <li>Policymakers</li>

        </ul>
        
    </p>    
    
    <h2>Shared Housing Placement Process: Pain Points</h2>
    
    <p>Below are some of the high-level pain points identified by LAFH with regards to the shared housing placement process:
        
        <ul>
            
            <li>Process is manual (vetting & matching is done manually, via discussions among case managers)</li>
            
            <li>Process takes too long (~ 1 month from unit identification to lease signing)</li>
            
            <li>Eligibility criteria are not clearly defined (who should be eligible for matching?)</li>
            
            <li>Matching criteria are not clearly defined (what criteria make for a successful tenant match?)</li>
            
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    
    <h2>Shared Housing Placement Process</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Unit identification</h3>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>Housing Location Team identifies eligible units & works with the Housing Navigation Team to drive interest & identify eligible individuals.
            
            <ul>
                
                <li>Generally, units should house no more than 4 participants. This number may increase given certain criteria, such as separate entrances, multiple bathrooms, etc.</li>
                
            </ul>
            
        </li>
        
        <li>Housing Navigation Team then shares the housing opportunity with those participants who are eligible for the unit and have expressed an interest in shared housing as part of their housing plan (shared housing is a choice and can not be forced upon the participant).</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Open House</h3>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>Generally, shared housing units are shown at “Open House” events hosted by the Housing Location Team.</li>
        
        <li>All participants interested in the unit should visit the unit and be educated about the neighborhood.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <b>Step 3: Case Conferencing</b>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>A list of the interested participants is gathered after the “Open House” event.</li>
        
        <li>Housing Navigation Team gets together to discuss potential barriers for these participants i.e. a participant has failed in shared housing in the past, has a hoarding issue, has gang affiliation that could impact resident safety, has children who need to visit, is a registered sex offender and can’t have other residents’ kids visit, etc.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Meetup & Roommate Agreement</h3>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>Participants who have been cleared by the Housing Navigation Team through case conferencing are given the opportunity to spend time together during a “Meet & Greet” event to discuss the issues that may arise when living together.</li>
        
        <li>A list of questions that can be used to help mediate this conversation is provided to the participants. This conversation should be had without particular intervention by case managers, but a mediator should be present to help push conversation forward.</li>
        
        <li>In addition, anyone participating in Shared Housing should utilize a Shared Housing Rental Agreement in order to codify the different decisions that roommates have made. This should be filled out with a case manager to help mediate any disagreements.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Step 5: Lease signing</h3>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>The participants come together to sign a lease.</li>
        
        <li>There’s one lease per roommate (each roommate signs a separate lease).</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Step 6: Stabiliation Support</h3>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>The Housing Stabilization team works with clients after they’ve been placed into shared housing to support & ensure a stable housing placement.</li>
        
    </ul>
