# Shared Housing, Front-End Meeting Notes, July 23, 2019

Written by: Eva Lieu
Participants: Roland, Kirk, Eva, Karl, Kenny, Chris, William, Brandon

## Topics:

1. Current focus for front-end:

   - Client only and should be able to hit endpoints for APIs
   - Basically micro-services
   - Needs to be modularized, use component composition
   - Should end up like a starter-kit we can hand off to stakeholders

2. Technologies:

   - Bundler: Parcel
   - Linting: Prettier
   - Type checking: TypeScript
   - Style library: Material UI, css, no sass
   - Forms: Formik
   - Testing: Jest, Enzyme
   - Component development tool: Storybook
   - Routing: React router
   - \*New issue -> Add all the technologies resources to ReadME

3. TypeScript:

   - \*New issue-> Need to add TypeScript
   - React PropTypes not enough because we'll need to write utility functions as well and propTypes doesn't account for everything.
   - TypeScript has more functionality and is type checking. Not everything we write is going to be React, so PropTypes won't work for other utility functions. Plus TypeScript is great!
   - TypeScript you can write different configs that can be shared across, whereas propTypes is isolated to the one component

4. Folder structure:
   client
   src
   assets
   components (grouped by feature, ie:)
   Form
   Button
   Input
   Chart
   hooks (custom hooks, eg useFetch)
   utils (helper functions etc: formats dates, iterates through objects)
   pages (page served up as you hit different routes)
   styles (css, no sass)
5. Storybook:
   - Component development tool
   - A story is a feature. Helps us keep a component library.
   - Read Atomic design by Brad Frost
6. Forms:
   - Using Formik for the functionality under the hood (ie: handleChange, handleBlur)
7. Github process:
   - Fork from shared-housing
   - Clone your fork to local environment
   - Create a new branch for your issue
   - \*New issue -> Write up github process on ReadMe.

## Actions Items:

1. Make a new issue to include TypeScript
2. Make a new issue to add new resources to readME
3. Make a new issue to write up Github process
4. Learn:
   - TypeScript
   - Jest
   - Enzyme (takes a snapshot and tells you diff), lodash(?)
   - Hooks, reducer
   - Redux(?) possible
5. Decide on how to use unit testing/ integration tests, figure out which components need what
6. Dashboards(?)
